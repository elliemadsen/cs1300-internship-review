# Design Choices

App.js includes three main vertically-stacked sections of the App: Header, Body, and Footer. All of the app's dynamic
functionality is included within Body.jsx.

Body includes two main vertically-stacked sections: FilteredList and FavoritesList. This class is also where the list
of all internship reviews and the list of favorited internship reviews are stored as a constant value and a state value,
respectively.

FilteredList determines which items should be displayed based on the fields the user has selected (including company,
location, position, industry, and sorting by year or rating). It also includes the html elements for the buttons that
allow the user to select these fields. Once the list of items that fit the selected fields are determined using filter,
map, and sort functions, this list is passed to DisplayList as a props item.

FavoritesList determines which items should be displayed within the Favorites section. It simply passes the list of
favorited items on the DisplayList as a props item.

DisplayList renders each item card using consistent styling.

Body.jsx passes a callback function to FilteredList and FavoritesList that allows items to be added to the list of
favorited items. Both FilteredList and FavoritesList pass on this function to DisplayList as a props field. This is
how user interactions with buttons rendered in the DisplayList class (namely the favorites star toggle) are able to
alter the state variable in Body.jsx.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
